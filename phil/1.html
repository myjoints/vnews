You will also need to decide between loose green tea and green tea teabags; while teabags are more convenient and there's nothing wrong with using them for flavor or strength, the loose tea may feel more authentic for a full experience of enjoying your green tea. Here are some green tea types to consider: [4] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> Lester A Mitscher, PhD and Victoria Dolby, i The Green Tea Book /i , pp. 142–145, (1998), ISBN 0-89529-807-4</span> </span> Gunpowder – the Chinese also call this "Pearl Tea". The tea resembles tiny gunpowder pellets. When water is added, the little pellets or pearls unfurl. This one stays freshest longest. Hyson – This has a very pungent taste, and has thick, yellow-green leaves twisted into thin and long shapes. Dragonwell – This variety is very popular in China. It tastes mellow and has a light green flavor. The leaves open to reveal a bud when water is added. Agarwood - mild traditional green tea taste. Make sure you use whole leaf tea vs tea made from the wood which is illegal to purchase. Pi Lo Chun – In Chinese this name translates to "Green Snail Spring". A rare tea, the little rolled leaves look like snails. Owing to the fact that the tea bushes are grown amid orchards, this tea tends to have the flavors of plums, peaches, and apricots embedded in the leaves. Matcha – This is powdered green tea leaves. It appears a bright green when water is added. Gu Zhang Mao Jian – This tea only uses the silvery-tipped young leaves picked within a set 10 day period during spring. While darker than other green teas, it has a smooth and sweet taste. Sencha – This is a common Japanese green tea. Jewel green matcha is a good choice for those who find other green tea too "grass" tasting.

The taste is savory and earthy. Also Japanese in origin. Gyokuro – This Japanese green tea has leaves that look like pine needles, with a sweet and smooth taste. The tea looks green. Hojicha – A tea with large, unrolled leaves. It tastes nutty. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/e\/ee\/Brew-Green-Tea-Step-2.jpg\/v4-460px-Brew-Green-Tea-Step-2.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/e\/ee\/Brew-Green-Tea-Step-2.jpg\/aid595808-v4-728px-Brew-Green-Tea-Step-2.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 2 <b> Store purchased tea in an airtight, dark container to avoid loss of its qualities; the aromatic oils evaporate if not stored this way.</b> Purchase small amounts only, and keep it in a cool spot.

If this doesn't bother you (indeed, you might not even notice the difference), just be sure to wash your regular teapot well. Green tea should only be brewed in ceramic, clay, china, glass, or stainless steel teapots. Do not use plastic or aluminum teapots.

Three minutes steeping results in light flavor, while five minutes will give you a robust, full flavor. The longer the green tea is left in, the stronger the taste, so you might like to experiment as to which taste works best for you. For high grade tea such as "gunpowder" types, steeping time may be as few as 10 seconds on first brew. You can reuse the leaves several times, steeping slightly longer with each batch. It is advisable to allow the leaves to rest for a few minutes after the first two brews so as not to burn or overwork them. Always time the brewing and taste the tea rather than relying on color changes. Some green teas turn dark quickly but are not ready, while some stay light but are ready sooner than you may think. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/3\/37\/Brew-Green-Tea-Step-13.jpg\/v4-460px-Brew-Green-Tea-Step-13.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/3\/37\/Brew-Green-Tea-Step-13.jpg\/aid595808-v4-728px-Brew-Green-Tea-Step-13.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 5 <b> Pour into a sieve (to catch any loose tea, if you don't want it in your drink) over cups, mugs, or glasses.</b> It is now ready to be enjoyed. In addition, Chinese green tea connoisseurs will also use a snifter cup to enhance the tea drinking experience. These cups are much smaller in diameter but longer in length to allow the scent to waft into the nostrils as you sip out of your main cup.

Community Answer You can, but the longer you had it in your first cup, the more watery the next one will be. Therefore the flavor will not be as good, nor will it be as strong. This is ill advised. <span> Thanks!</span> Yes No Not Helpful <span> 3</span> Helpful <span> 8</span> Question Can I boil water &amp; the leaves simultaneously or do I need to pour water over it afterwards? Community Answer Actually, it doesn't matter, but most people would pour water over it because if you leave it to long in the boiling water, the tea bag will explode. <span> Thanks!</span> Yes No Not Helpful <span> 3</span> Helpful <span> 2</span> Question Does adding ice to green tea make it lose any benefits it would've had when hot? Community Answer No. Adding ice will potentially water your drink down and dilute it, but it is still the same drink with all the same benefits. <span> Thanks!</span> Yes No Not Helpful <span> 0</span> Helpful <span> 2</span> Question Can green tea be boiled longer to extract more nutrients? Community Answer Sure, you can infuse the tea to be as strong as you like it! This will extract more nutrients, although the same effect can be achieved by steeping the same leaves twice. Also, remember not to use boiling water, the water should be about 175° when you add the green tea. <span> Thanks!</span> Yes No Not Helpful <span> 8</span> Helpful <span> 4</span> Question At what temperature will a tea kettle start to whistle? Community Answer The tea kettle will start to whistle when the water begins to boil, which occurs at 212 degrees Fahrenheit (or 100 degrees Celsius). <span> Thanks!</span> Yes No Not Helpful <span> 2</span> Helpful <span> 1</span> Question When I boil Sencha, the tea is red. When I steep it overnight, it is amber. Nutritionally, which is better? <span> Demi Lavapies</span> Community Answer It is more nutritious to drink it when it is red because the amber is stale. <span> Thanks!</span> Yes No Not Helpful <span> 1</span> Helpful <span> 0</span> Ask a Question 200 characters left Include your email address to get a message when this question is answered.

Although many new tea drinkers may enjoy it this way, it's not a traditional way to drink green tea.
