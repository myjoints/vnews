This abundance of antioxidants led green tea to the celebrated and treasured beverage that it is now. But green tea, aside from containing a high amount of caffeine, packs more than that. It can also be enjoyed in a myriad of ways. Today, let&#8217;s learn how to brew green tea together!</p> <p> Table of Contents</p> <span> <i> </i> </span> What Does Cold Brew Green Tea Mean? Why is Cold Brew Green Tea the New Hot Trend? How does Cold Brew Green Tea Taste? Commercial Cold Brew Green Tea vs. Homemade Cold Brew Green Tea How to Make Homemade Cold Brew Green Tea? Unique Recipes to Try with Cold Brew Green Tea <h2> <span> </span> What Does Cold Brew Green Tea Mean?<span> </span> </h2> <span> photo by Pickled Plum Food and Drinks /embedded from Pinterest</span> <p> Cold brew green tea is green tea from the Camellia sinensis plant that is infused in cold water instead of the customary pouring of hot water over the loose leaves. Unlike the hot green tea we are familiar with, cold brew green tea takes a bit of time before it could be enjoyed since the process could take a few hours to overnight. The process would require either cold or room-temperature, and soaking the leaves for a minimum of 12 hours. This brewing process allows the water to extract the flavor, sugar, oils, and caffeine from the leaves.</p> <p> After brewing, oftentimes a large batch, one would start transferring these freshly brewed green tea to separate bottles that are perfect for single serving. There are many entrepreneurs selling bottled cold brew teas and coffees that are usually available on social media platforms.</p> <h2> <span> </span> Why is Cold Brew Green Tea the New Hot Trend?<span> </span> </h2> <span> photo by denise rombaut/embedded from Pinterest</span> <p> Green tea has always been on everyone&#8217;s honor roll of tea types for its health benefits, but the cold brew process seems to elevate the beverage to a whole new level. Just like how people have revered cold brew coffee for the milder cup of joe, people are doing the same for cold brew green tea. While we have been familiar with cold brew coffee for quite some time, tea leaves infused in cold water are just starting to take hold. The green tea advantage? Its refreshing flavor profile and the seemingly endless possibilities to make with the drink, all without losing its health advantages.</p> <p> Brewing tea in cold water is seen as the healthier alternative to a piping hot cup. The Journal of Science and Technology in its 2015 study has observed that the polyphenols and antioxidants of green tea are better preserved in the cold water infusion compared with the hot water method. The epigallocatechin gallate or EGCG was seen to be doubled through this steeping process, the highest levels that the researchers have recorded for green tea.</p> <p> Lower levels of caffeine are also detected in a cup of cold brew green tea, letting the beverage be consumed by those who may have adverse reactions to caffeine. These are individuals who suffer from extreme anxiety , constipation , diarrhea, or nausea . </p> <p> Tannins are also greatly reduced, if not completely eliminated, in the cooler process. Hot water is believed to extract tannins from the leaves which gives the drink a bitter flavor. This strong taste is what often strays people away from green tea, and with that unpleasant quality gone, people are more inclined to start their tea journey with the cold brew method of this variant.</p> <p> The study also noted that while the traditional and ancient method for preparing green tea has been the hot brewing process, there are promising effects of greater antioxidant activity in the relatively new method of steeping.</p> <h2> <span> </span> How does Cold Brew Green Tea Taste?<span> </span> </h2> <p> The absence of hot water removes the quick infusion process of green tea and reduces the tannin reaction of the dried leaves, depriving the tea of its classic bitter flavor. The slower, more time-consuming brew lends itself to a lighter taste that may be consumed even by tea newbies. Surprisingly eliminating the bitter characteristic known to green tea, the cold brew method makes it more invigorating. That is why some people are hailing cold brew green tea as their summer drink, a healthier iced tea option sans the sugar.</p> <h2> <span> </span> Commercial Cold Brew Green Tea vs. Homemade Cold Brew Green Tea<span> </span> </h2> <span> Pure Leaf</span> Get Yours Here <p> Most tea brands in the market have their own packaged versions of this green tea drink. Often coming in boxes of 12 to 24 tea bags, these easy to brew packets provide convenience to those who want to fulfill their cold brew green tea craving immediately. The commercial products cut back a huge amount of waiting time compared to brewing your tea at home. Although the taste and refreshing quality are not that different, cold brew green tea enthusiasts still advocate the loose leaf, do-it-yourself version. </p> <p> But if you are in a pinch and all you have are some tea bags at home, here&#8217;s a widely-done hack: cut your teabags open and dump the crushed tea leaves into the pitcher. It may not be the loose leaf version, but at least that is the closest you can get to an authentic cold brew green tea.</p> <h2> <span> </span> How to Make Homemade Cold Brew Green Tea?<span> </span> </h2> <p> Deciding to make your own cold brew green tea is a relaxing activity in itself. Aside from the novelty of this process, consuming the infusion that you have patiently waited for adds to the fulfilling feeling of serving something homemade.</p> <h3> Ingredients</h3> <p> Loose leaf green tea, water</p> <h3> Tools</h3> <p> Pitcher; strainer, cheesecloth, infuser, or paper filter</p> <h3> Steps</h3> <span> Step 1: Determine the amount of cold brew green tea that you want to come up with. Do you need a cup just for yourself? Or will you be serving a big batch to your family and friends? The measurement ratio of tea leaves and water will depend on that. Generally, one to two teaspoons of loose green tea leaves is needed for every cup of water. </span> <span> Step 2: Once you&#8217;ve decided the amount, drop the tea leaves in water and allow them to be steeped. Some say that the tea brewed for a minimum of six hours results in a good batch, while others suggest a minimum brewing time of 12 hours. Forty-eight hours seem to be the agreed maximum infusion. Place the pitcher or jar of your choice in the fridge.</span> <span> Step 3: Remove the leaves using a strainer, cheesecloth, or paper filter. If you used an infuser, just simply separate it from the pitcher before serving. Serve immediately.</span> <p> Making your own cold brew green tea is largely dependent on your preferred amount and flavor strength. Packed tea bags may be used for this drink, although you could expect a milder brew compared to the recommended loose leaves. If you&#8217;re using organic , loose leaf green tea, you may rebrew them for a couple of times before switching to a fresh batch without losing its potency. To relieve you of the extra process of straining before serving, feel free to use your trusty French press too.</p> <h2> <span> </span> Unique Recipes to Try with Cold Brew Green Tea<span> </span> </h2> <span> photo by Pamela Curran /embedded from Pinterest</span> <p> Steeping the tea leaves in cold water is just the first step in creating multiple refreshing concoctions. Although it tastes good on its own, cold brew green tea also serves as an ideal base for blended drinks. It ultimately results in a fantastic, thirst-quenching glass and emphasizes the flexibility of the simple green tea.</p> <h3> The classic tandem of honey and lemon</h3> <p> While adding a teaspoon of sweet honey is not exactly new when it comes to tea preparation, mixing in the golden syrup raises the status of cold brew green tea from refreshing to rejuvenating. Squeeze in a lemon or two just like you would in an ordinary jug of iced tea and watch as the beverage becomes the crowd-favorite in your annual summer parties.</p> <h3> Easy-peasy citrus party</h3> <p> The lighter taste of cold brew green tea makes a great launching pad for the citrusy profiles of lime and lemon. Slice the fruits and extract their juices before pouring into the pitcher of cool green tea. Garnish with heaps of mint leaves for presentation and the minty flavor will seep its way into the drink too.</p> <h3> Blooming green tea</h3> <p> Fusing the blooming flowers of roses with the dried leaves of Camellia sinensis may seem ridiculous at first glance, but the resulting refreshment leaves the taste buds wanting for more. You may add a dash of rose water extract if you are feeling a bit cautious, but if you want to go the extra mile, drop some dried rose petals for a pretty drink. Plus points if you are outdoors because the drink&#8217;s taste is reminiscent of gardens and parks. Rose, when consumed as a beverage, has tons of benefits too, like its digestive and diuretic effects. Paired with antioxidant-rich green tea, you know it&#8217;s an honest-to-goodness cup.</p> <h3> Green Tea Heineken Bubble Tea By Boba 7</h3> <p> This drink is inspired by a boba tea from Boba 7 . If you’re thinking of having a few drinks, try mixing your cold brew green tea with Heineken or your preferred beer. This would make you feel less bloated despite the carbonation from the beer.</p> <p> Despite it having a rich cultural background, a growing and unending list of health claims, and a whole slew of preparation methods, green tea remains to be the staple pantry item that we should be giving our attention to, most especially if it is in its healthiest and most refreshing form: cold brewed green tea.</p> <span> TAGS</span> Benefits of Tea <i> </i> Share <i> </i> Facebook <i> </i> Twitter <i> </i> Pinterest <i> </i> WhatsApp <i> </i> ReddIt <i> </i> Tumblr <i> </i> LINE <i> </i> <span> Previous article</span> Why is Chamomile Tea Good for Babies? <span> Next article</span> The Best 15 Korean Tea Brands Everyone Should Know <span> Tamntea </span> <span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> </span> <h4> RELATED ARTICLES MORE FROM AUTHOR </h4> Tea Stories <h3> 16 Teas To Shake Off Your Bad Mood </h3> Herbal &amp; Fruit &amp; Blended Tea <h3> Turmeric Tea and Its Golden Health Benefits </h3> Herbal &amp; Fruit &amp; Blended Tea <h3> 10 Magical Health Benefits of Turmeric Tea </h3> Herbal &amp; Fruit &amp; Blended Tea <h3> How Essiac Tea May Help Cancer Patients </h3> Herbal &amp; Fruit &amp; Blended Tea <h3> How Healthy is Moringa Tea? </h3> Herbal &amp; Fruit &amp; Blended Tea <h3> Best Anti-Aging Tea: Rosehip Tea </h3> Herbal &amp; Fruit &amp; Blended Tea <h3> Surprising Benefits of Drinking Anise Tea </h3> Herbal &amp; Fruit &amp; Blended Tea <h3> What is Fennel Tea and Why Should I Drink it? </h3> Tea Stories <h3> 12 Best Teas to Help with Vomiting </h3> <i> </i> <i> </i> <h4> <span> Don t miss</span> </h4> <h3> The Top 10 Diet Teas for Weight loss! </h3> <span> 12/01/2020 </span> <h3> The Best Tea To Drink To Cure Your Cold </h3> <span> 30/07/2019 </span> <h3> Top 8 Teas that can Help with Weight Loss! </h3> <span> 19/01/2020 </span> <h4> <span> Languages</span> </h4> ENGLISH CHINESE ESPAÑOL <h4> <span> Trending Tags</span> </h4> Alcohol Bancha Benefits of Tea Bubble Tea Bubble Tea Shop Diet DIY Genmaicha Gift Ideas Goishicha Gyokuro Herbs Houjicha How to Buy Japanese Alcohol Japanese Soft Drink Japanese Tea Brand Konacha Kukicha Loose Leaf Tea Matcha Organic Tea Recipes sake Seasonal Tea Sencha Shochu Tea Brand Tea Ceremony Tea of China Tea of Japan Tea of Philippine Tool Vegan Wagashi Weight Loss What to Buy Where to Drink In Florida Where to Drink In France Where to Drink In Hawaii Where to Drink in Hong Kong Where to Drink in Japan Where to Drink in New York Where to Drink In UK Where to Drink in US <h4> <span> Search</span> </h4> <h4> <span> CATEGORY</span> </h4> <i> </i> <span> TEA STORIES</span> GREEN TEA OOLONG TEA HERBAL&#038; FRUIT &#038; BLENDED TEA <i> </i> <span> TEA MEETS FOOD</span> <i> </i> <span> TEA WITH BEAUTY</span> <i> </i> <span> TEAWARE</span> <i> </i> <span> TEA HOUSES</span> <h4> <span> FIND US</span> </h4> ABOUT US PRIVACY POLICY CONTACT US TERMS AND CONDITIONS <h4> <span> FOLLOW US</span> </h4> <span> 22</span> <span> Fans</span> <span> Like </span> <span> 14</span> <span> Followers</span> <span> Follow </span> <h4> <span> LANGUAGES</span> </h4> ENGLISH CHINESE ESPAÑOL &copy; Tam&Tea All rights reserved. | Email: cs@tamntea.com
