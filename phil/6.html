This traditional Chinese medicine has innumerable health benefits. Be it cardiovascular or neurodegenerative diseases, obesity, diabetes, skin disorders, kidney disease or cancer, the antioxidants in green tea can fight ’em all  ( 1 ), ( 2 ), ( 3 ).</p> <p> But, the problem is, most of us do not know the correct way to prepare green tea. And, if you don’t prepare it correctly, it will not provide any health benefit and will end up tasting bitter and grassy. So, it is important that you understand and master the method of preparing green tea. Read on to find out how to make green tea, that will rejuvenate and cleanse your body. But first, let me tell you a tad bit about green tea.</p> <p> <strong> Table Of Contents</strong> </p> What Is Green Tea? How Green Tea Works To Improve Your Health How To Make Green Tea At Home Green Tea Brewing Tips Healthy Green Tea Recipes Types Of Green Tea How To Buy And Store Green Tea Best Green Tea Brands To Consider <h2> What Is Green Tea?</h2> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> Image: Shutterstock</p> <p> The practice of drinking green tea originated in China. Legend has it that it was discovered by Shannong, the Emperor of China, in 2737 B.C when a few tea tree leaves fell into his cup of boiled water. Later, Chinese monks started drinking green tea for refreshment and to help them meditate. They would often travel to India and other places to spread Buddhism, and they took this miracle drink with them. Thereafter, green tea gained popularity.</p> <p> Green tea or Camellia sinensis is a non-fermented tea that is rich in antioxidants ( 4 ). Though green tea, black tea, and oolong tea all come from the same plant, Camellia sinensis, green tea leaves have to be picked differently. The tea pickers have to pick the fresh leaves from the apex. These leaves are then processed in a way that prevents too much oxidation. And it is this picking and processing ritual that makes green tea so antioxidant-rich.</p> <p> The green tea from China has smaller leaves whereas the green tea from Assam, India has larger leaves. However, both provide the same health benefits. But, how does green tea work really? Find out next.</p> <p> <strong> Back To TOC</strong> </p> <h2> How Green Tea Improves Your Health</h2> <p> The catechins in green tea are antioxidants, which are responsible for all the health benefits. The main catechins present in green tea are epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin-3 gallate (ECG), and epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG). But the most potent catechin is EGCG ( 5 ). Now, since EGCG is an antioxidant, it scavenges the harmful free oxygen radicals and protects the DNA from damage, prevents unlimited cell proliferation, blocks cancer signaling pathways, prevents fat accumulation, protects from microbial infections, decreases fatigue, and strengthens the immune system ( 6 ). It is, therefore, clear that drinking green tea on a regular basis improves your health in many different ways. So, without much ado, let me tell you how you should prepare green tea at home.</p> <p> <strong> Back To TOC</strong> </p> <h2> How To Make Green Tea At Home</h2> <p> Making the perfect cup of green tea involves just a few steps. You can prepare green tea in mainly two different ways but can add many other useful ingredients along with green tea. Let’s start with the basic recipes.</p> <h3> 1. How To Prepare Green Tea With Leaves</h3> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> Image: Shutterstock</p> <p> Green tea preparation is different than that of black tea that we make at home. You need to follow some simple steps. While making green tea, do keep in mind that if the tea leaves are steeped in water that’s over 90°C, the tea will become bitter. So, steep it in water that’s not too hot. Here are the steps for green tea brewing with leaves.</p> <h4> What You Need</h4> Green tea leaves – the basic quantity would be 1 teaspoon for 1 cup of green tea. You may also use green tea pearls. A tea strainer. Wash and dry it – this step is necessary if you use this strainer to make regular black tea. A cup A stainless steel pot 1 cup of water <h4> Method</h4> <h5> Step 1</h5> <p> Take one teaspoon of green tea leaves. If you want to make more than a cup of green tea, take 1 teaspoon of green tea leaves for each cup. So, take 4 teaspoons of green tea leaves for 4 cups of green tea.</p> <h5> Step 2</h5> <p> Now, take the tea leaves in a strainer/sieve and keep aside.</p> <h5> Step 3</h5> <p> Now, take a stainless steel pot/pan and boil the water. If you want to use a glass teapot instead, go ahead. The ideal temperature for green tea is 80°C to 85°C, so keep an eye on the water to make sure it’s not boiling. If it starts boiling anyway, just switch off the gas/heat and let it cool for a bit (say, for 30-45 seconds).</p> <h5> Step 4</h5> <p> Now, place the sieve/ strainer over the cup or mug.</p> <h5> Step 5</h5> <p> Next, pour the hot water into the cup and let the tea steep for 3 minutes. This is the step where we need to be very careful. Not everyone likes their tea strong, so, to check whether the tea is just right, keep a spoon handy and drink a spoonful of tea every 30-45 seconds to find out if the flavor is right for you.</p> <h5> Step 6</h5> <p> Now, take out the sieve and keep it aside. If you want, you may add 1 teaspoon honey.</p> <h5> Step 7</h5> <p> Stir the honey in and let the drink cool for a few seconds. Enjoy your cup of green tea.</p> <p> <strong> Back To TOC</strong> </p> <h3> 2. How To Make Green Tea With Tea Bags</h3> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> Image: Shutterstock</p> <p> Green tea bags are, well, convenient for many people. They are portable and can be made into a hot cuppa quickly – all you need is a cup of hot water. So, here’s how you can prepare a cup of green tea with a green tea bag. If you are using tea bags, make sure they are made from an unbleached material. Most tea bags are bleached to make them white, and you definitely don’t want any bleach contaminating your antioxidant-rich drink!</p> <h4> What You Need</h4> 1 good quality green tea bag 1 cup of hot water 1 stainless steel/clay cup A lid to cover the cup A stainless steel pot <h4> Method</h4> <h5> Step 1</h5> <p> Heat the water in a stainless steel pot. Make sure it doesn’t come to a boiling point, which is 100 degrees C. The temperature of the water should be around 80-85 degrees C.</p> <h5> Step 2</h5> <p> Put the green tea bag into the clay or stainless steel cup.</p> <h5> Step 3</h5> <p> Pour the hot water into the cup and cover it with a small lid. Let it steep for 3 minutes.</p> <h5> Step 4</h5> <p> After 3 minutes is over, remove the lid and remove the tea bag.</p> <h5> Step 5</h5> <p> Stir with a spoon and take a rejuvenating sip!</p> <h3> 3. How To Brew Green Tea With Powder</h3> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> Image: Shutterstock</p> <p> You may also prepare green tea using green tea powder, which is available readily in the market. Here’s the best way to make green tea using green tea powder.</p> <h4> What You Need</h4> Green tea powder – 1 and ½ teaspoon Water – 1 cup 1 teaspoon of honey <h4> Method</h4> <h5> Step 1</h5> <p> Take a cup of water in a stainless steel bowl or glass bowl and heat it. Remember, green tea turns bitter when it is overheated, so just keep a check on the temperature. Use a kitchen thermometer to see if it’s around 85°C.</p> <h5> Step 2</h5> <p> Turn the heat off once it reaches the boiling point. Now, let it cool for a few seconds.</p> <h5> Step 3</h5> <p> Add the green tea powder to the water. The ideal green tea brew time to soak is about 3 minutes, but you may take a sip after 1 ½ minutes to check if the flavor is strong enough.</p> <h5> Step 4</h5> <p> After 3 minutes, the color should have changed to brown. Pour it through a strainer.</p> <h5> Step 5</h5> <p> Add honey to the tea and pour into the cup.</p> <p> So, this was all about the preparation of green tea in three simple methods. Though this may seem to be easy, the secret of making a perfect cup of green tea lies in the way you brew it. So, here are a few green tea brewing tips that will help you get the right taste and flavor.</p> <p> <strong> Back To TOC</strong> </p> <h2> Green Tea Brewing Tips</h2> <span> <span> </span> </span> <p> Image: Shutterstock</p> <h3> Maintain Tea To Water Ratio</h3> <p> When it comes to preparing green tea, you must maintain 3:5 green tea to water ratio. This means if you take 3 grams of green tea, you must take 5 oz water to prepare it.</p> <h3> Water Quality</h3> <p> Earlier, water was less polluted, but now it’s a different story. Therefore, we emphasize on the quality of water. The water that you use must be filtered. You can also use tap water if you trust the source. Do not use distilled water.</p> <h3> Water Temperature</h3> <p> Water temperature is highly crucial when it comes to preparing green tea. Do not boil the water as too hot water can reduce the healthy properties of green tea. Always maintain a temperature of 85 degrees C or 170 degrees F.</p> <h3> Brewing Vessel</h3> <p> Choose a small brewing vessel, about 100-200 ml, for a single serving. You can use traditional Chinese or Japanese tea brewing vessels. They are known as gaiwan or shiboridashi .</p> <h3> Steep Time</h3> <p> You do not need to steep it for too long. A good 2-3 minutes will do the trick. Moreover, if you steep green tea beyond the limit of 3 minutes, the green tea will turn bitter and grassy in taste.</p> <h3> Removing The Tea</h3> <p> You may use a strainer to pour the tea into a different cup. Or, you can use an infuser.</p> <p> Now, wouldn’t be a bit boring to drink the same green tea over and over again? Or, what if you are someone who just doesn’t enjoy drinking green tea but would still like to reap all the health benefits of green tea ? Well, I have good news for you.
